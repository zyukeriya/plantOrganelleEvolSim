# plantOrganelleEvolSim
Plant mitochondrial and plastid DNA neutral evolution within the plant gremline designed for Zostera marina

## Description
Welcome to the plant organelle neutral evolution simulation. This python3 script follows the fate of novel mutations in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes. It is designed for _Zostera marina_, although many parameters are adjustable directly in the config file. For more details, see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.15.567200v1 

## Execution
  `python3 Plant_organelle_neutral_evolution_simulation.py config_example.yml`

Note that some python packages need to be pre-installed.
Files PopState.py and data_analysis.py should be placed in the same directory as the main script Plant_organelle_neutral_evolution_simulation.py.
