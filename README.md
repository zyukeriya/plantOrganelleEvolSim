# plantOrganelleEvolSim
Plant mitochondrial and plastid DNA neutral evolution within the plant gremline designed for Zostera marina

## Description
Welcome to the plant organelle neutral evolution simulation. This python3 script follows the fate of novel mutations in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes. It is designed for <i>Zostera marina</i>, although many parameters are adjustable directly in the config file. For more details, see: ???

## Execution
>python3 Plant_organelle_neutral_evolution_simulation.py config_example.yml
Note that some python packages need to be pre-installed.
Files PopState.py and data_analysis.py should be placed in the same directory as the main script Plant_organelle_neutral_evolution_simulation.py.
